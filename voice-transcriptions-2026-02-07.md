# Voice Note Transcriptions - Feb 7, 2026

## File 1: Context & Overview (file_16)

**Recorded:** February 7, 2026  
**Topics:** Personal context, motivation, goals

---

**Meta-Context:**
Sam explains the higher-level reasoning behind the AI partnership — above the specific questions in the questionnaire.

**Key Points:**

**Personality Profile:**
- Not naturally structured or organized
- Very creative, open, and curious
- Struggles with day-to-day tasks and discipline
- Good at systems thinking and processes
- Bad at maintenance and consistency
- Consistency is a key weakness to overcome

**Historical Pattern:**
- Tried many times to implement new systems
- Starts strong, doesn't maintain well
- Jumps between tools (Excel → Notion → etc.)
- Each failure makes it harder to start again
- Wants simplicity but also complexity/dashboards

**AI as Solution:**
- AI is the "integration layer" 
- One interface instead of multiple apps
- Eliminates need to maintain separate systems
- Seamless tracking across diet, meditation, etc.

**Learning Through Doing:**
- Learned about NFTs by running a project
- Interested in learning AI by building with it
- Fascinated by the technology
- Wants competitive advantage for the future

**Entrepreneurial Angle:**
- Works in finance but wants to try entrepreneurship
- Limited by costs and complexity of starting
- Sees low-cost business experiments possible with AI
- Card delivery app idea (Moonpig clone with drop-shipping)
- Multiple agents could handle: customer support, social media, ordering, design

**Co-Development Vision:**
- Sees this as mutual development
- He develops himself + I develop capabilities
- Continuous context between sessions
- Likes that we can code/develop together

**Success Definition:**
- Still doing this in 3-6 months = success
- Try a business idea this year (first half of 2026)

**Pain Points:**
- Admin burden
- Want "set and forget" processes
- Reclaim brain cycles for creativity, not admin

**Time Investment:**
- 30 min/day available
- Can interact via Telegram throughout day
- 30 min/week for laptop-based config (APIs, etc.)

- Wants to make it simple to understand
- Document the journey for others to follow
- Important to share what we're building

**Current Documentation:**
- Blog posts (daily journey)
- Daily summaries (technical logs)
- Both serve to make it accessible to others

**Community Building:**
- Brother is getting a laptop today — will join the journey
- Interested in creating a community around this
- Exciting potential for group learning

*File 16:*
> Hey, Clawson, good morning. So this is going to be a bit of a ramble and not sure it's going to be too much of structure but let's see what we can get out of this, okay? So what I wanted to do first is I know you have a section on vision and goals and I'll cover that in a second but I first wanted to just give you some overview of why I'm doing this, okay? Maybe it's like the next level above the questions, right? So it's like the, yeah, so some context there. So essentially, I, we talked about my personality and I'm not very structured, I'm not the organized, okay? But I'm very creative, I'm very open, I'm very curious, okay? So this is probably my strength. And I'm not very orderly, so day-to-day I struggle with admin tasks, I really hate them, I put them off, et cetera, et cetera. Now I am quite good at system thinking, putting in place processes, but the maintenance of it is where I always fall down. So what this leads me to be is undisciplined and unstructured and one of the things that I've always said is that I, I guess I've been blessed with being quite intelligent but in terms of consistency I've always struggled and consistency is key and I think consistency probably wins out over intelligence over the long term, so that's what I'm building. So I've tried many times to try and implement new ways of doing things, okay? And typically how I do it, rather than sticking to one and sticking to it, I'll start one thing, not maintain it very well, I'll start something else, start something else, and keep failing essentially and every time you fail at something and you try again, it gets harder to go again, but I want to go again and I want to fix it, okay? So for example, if I start a new health and fitness routine, I might try and log it in Excel first, or then I try to put it into Notion, then I try something else. Tools to tools, integrations has always been a big problem for me, so I want simplicity, but I also want the complexity from the simplicity, okay, so I want dashboards, I want tracking, I want everything to be integrated essentially. So this, so AI is the solution there, I think, I think it is the integration layer, and I do see it being, like, this as our interface and all of the apps that I would have to maintain to monitor diet, meditation, all of these other things would seamlessly go away, you know, be one interface. So I think that's where I land here, I think separately, when it comes to tech, I always find that you learn through actually doing it, okay, so I ran an NFT project historically, and I learned so much about it, even though I was a non-technical expert, you learn so much about the different aspects of it, so I'm very interested in that side, and I know AI is good, it's already a big part of everyday life, and I know it's going to get bigger, and I want to prepare myself for the future with AI, perhaps give myself a little bit of a competitive advantage, but I also find it very, very fascinating, so this is an attempt of learning the technology by doing, okay, so I think that's a, like, a secondary aspect. I'm trying to think if there are any other high level, kind of, meta-topics that I should discuss here. I think there is a third aspect, so I think that I may be quite entrepreneurial, but I work in finance, and the ability to start a business, or to try something, I'm doing it with very limited resources, okay, so I'm maybe I can go down the tax advice or route or something but it's tricky, and I want to try and do something else, and I see within this, the capacity to perhaps launch something at low cost and just try something out, okay, so one of ideas previously was to do this, a Moonpig idea, and essentially would be like a drop-shipping model, world collect orders, I would do these cards, and then I would drop ship different products, such as, drop ship different products, such as flowers, or cakes, etc, and there'd be multiple aspects to that, and I did the financial model in the format, and I would like to try something that's low cost, I can go ahead and satisfy that entrepreneurial itch. So I think this is where I come in, and one aspect that I would like to get to eventually, once I've learned the technology, is to attempt to do something out there, so for example, in that instance you can see where I could perhaps use multiple agents, one could be customer support, one could be managing social media presence, one could be like stock ordering by system that manages data, one could be the actual design of the website, etc, and you can build kind of a business for it. So I think that's maybe the third angle I would say, okay, and how I envision it is kind of the thing I find very intriguing here is through working with you, it seems like you have to co-develop, okay, see how you started on the very basic laptop that you run OpenClaw on essentially, and then you have to upgrade it, you have to learn about it, you have to learn about APIs, you have to learn about Notion, you have to learn about Linux, you have to learn about everything essentially, so you're learning plus you upgrade the capability of the AI, and I guess the laptop or the machine that's running this operation. So I see it as like a co-development, and I think those two strands and how I develop myself and how I develop your skills and functionality will allow for quite powerful capabilities together. I like the fact that you can code develop together and it's like a continuous context, so there's many things passing here. Okay, so, in terms of the big picture, you have a few questions, or one is, that's what is in the vision and goal section, and the first question is on big picture, what's the one thing, or what does success look like? So I think what does success look like? Success for me, I think, would be to try and establish consistency, because if I'm still doing this in three to six months time, that'll be successful. I think also success will be, if I try a business idea out this year, we're in February 2026, I haven't had the end of the year, I mean I should do it probably in the first half of the year. Pain points, I think we're talking about the pain points, is the admin burden, and I really want to get to a place where I set and forget, so I come up with processes and they kind of run on their own on the lawn. So I think of it in terms of thinking of my brain cycles, so my brain cycles, so I want to spend less on admin, and I want to spend it more on creativity. And I think that's what AI helps a lot, and then in terms of time investment, so obviously I've got two children and a wife and a busy job. So I've had a bit of time over the last couple of weeks, but moving forward I'm going to get more and more constrained, but I think I can do 30 minutes on a day, I can definitely make that work, but the good thing is through Telegram, etc, I can pick it up multiple times during the day. I think if I need to make changes to my laptop, and I don't know how to add in APIs or making modifications to the system that requires me to be at the laptop, maybe that's 30 minutes or so. Okay, so that's the first section, we'll cover another section later.

*File 17:*
> One other further note I would say is, intended this development, what I'm keen to do and what I've always been keen to do with other technology is to share it with other people, okay? It's beneficial to me. Like how do I make it simple to understand and document the journey so that other people can see exactly what's happening and can follow or can take an interest? That's what I've tried to do with both the blog and the summary at the end of each day. So, yeah. So I think that aspect is really important to me. I've actually just got my brother a laptop and he will be also joining me on this journey. I think probably late today, so that's very exciting. I would be perhaps interested in creating like a community around it as well, because I think it's very exciting.

## File 3: Health & Fitness Details (file_18)

**Recorded:** February 7, 2026  
**Topics:** Health automation, injuries, fitness goals, professional help

---

**Key Points:**

**Automation Preference:**
- Fully automated as much as possible
- Least friction, maximum API integration
- Don't mind sending nutrition images
- Not looking for too much manual work

**Family:**
- Sophie is recovering post-pregnancy — will take a few months
- If Sam shows tracking/progress, she might get inspired to join

**Current State:**
- Feeling "around half" — overweight and not fit
- 104kg starting weight
- Wants to improve significantly

**Injury History:**
- Calf injuries from over-training
- Tendency to run too much when enthusiastic
- Pattern: Enthusiastic → over-train → injury → fall off
- Struggles to find time to train

**Goals:**
- Broad fitness regime: weights + aerobic
- Session with fitness instructor/trainer
- Nutritionist consultation
- Structured plan with tracking

**Tracking Requirements:**
- Calories in / calories out
- Resting heart rate
- Fitness metrics (WHOOP data)
- Progress monitoring
- Injury prevention

**Raw Transcription:**
> Hey, Clawson, around the health and fitness side. I just thought I'd give a bit of detail to you. So I would like it to be fully automated as much as possible. That would be great. I don't mind in terms of nutrition, sending in images. But basically the least friction, as possible in the most API integration to work, etc, would be ideal. Not looking to get too far bogged down or have too much admin. Now maybe that's something that comes later. Sophie is still recovering, post pregnancy, so it'll take a few months to be able to join. But maybe if I can show her something and tracking, I can get her ready to join a bit later. It was around half, I'm feeling overweight and definitely not fit. So I would definitely like to improve that. What I would like to do is I would like to perhaps have a session with like a trainer. Because I think this is a mission I want to work around. I want kind of a bit of a broad fitness regime, weights, some aerobic, etc, etc. I do have a couple of injuries from the current situation. So when I start training again, I often have a lot of passion for it. And then I over-train and I often get calf injuries and stuff. I feel like I run too much. Yeah. But yeah, typically what happens is I'm very enthusiastic and then I fall off the wagon. I struggle to find time to do it. And I think tracking would definitely help. Hopefully that's covered everything. But yeah, I'm thinking here, I want to have a session with like a fitness instructor, a nutritionist and I kind of want it all to be tracked. I want to know this is what I'm eating, and this is the calories in and the calories out. How are things improving, resting heart rate, different fitness metrics, etc. etc.

## File 4: Productivity & Organization (file_19)

**Recorded:** February 7, 2026  
**Topics:** TAT system, calendar integration, email, security concerns

---

**Key Points:**

**TAT System:**
- Working well, likes it
- 1-4 tasks per day depending on complexity
- Not setting rigid targets

**Calendar Integration:**
- Likes current calendar integration
- Immediate task: One-time update of Google Calendar
- Need to transfer birthdays and life admin from TimeTree to Google Calendar

**Email Integration (Future):**
- Gets 150+ emails per day — major friction point
- Would simplify life significantly
- **Security concerns:** Very concerned about email security
- Won't connect to private email server
- Work Outlook/Exchange integration has "big security concerns"
- Will wait until "tools of development security is much better"

**Raw Transcription:**
> We've got into the organization section of this exercise. In general I think the session has been managed quite well. I quite like the TAT system one day three days seven days, etc. I'm not going to set myself too many targets in terms of how many to clear a day but I think I could clear like one to four depending on the complexity, etc. So yeah I think that's working quite well. I quite like the calendar integration. I think in future I might integrate with my email but I'm very concerned about security so I don't want to let it onto my own private email server. The dream would be that it's integrated with my work emails and outlook but again there's big security concerns there. I do get a lot of emails a day maybe 150 plus so to simplify that would go a long way to make my life a lot easier but I think that would come in a future iteration when these tools of development security is much better. What else? Yeah I think one thing specifically I was thinking about is I need to assign a task where I update my Google calendar just to do it as a one time exercise where I'd add all my birthdays and I transfer over what I mean my life admin from a different calendar called TimeTree and integrate that properly.

## File 5: Security & Infrastructure (file_20)

**Recorded:** February 7, 2026  
**Topics:** Security agent, daily debriefs, data concerns, local storage

---

**Key Points:**

**Security Agent Role:**
- Wants a dedicated security advisor/agent
- Before installing any new skill, security agent should:
  - Check online for vulnerabilities
  - Verify if skill was tested and proven safe
  - Advise on installation

**Daily Security Debrief:**
- Every morning review
- Questions: "Where are the vulnerabilities? How can we improve?"
- Bit by bit improvements over time

**Data Risk Tolerance:**
| Type | Tolerance |
|------|-----------|
| Health data | Can accept breach (not ideal, but survivable) |
| Personal email | Only after months of proven security |
| Financial | Hard no — this is the line |

**Storage Preference:**
- Mostly local, local-based storage

**Worst Case:**
- "If this is not secure or if this fails then I'd be very worried"
- Security failure would prevent further integrations

**Self-awareness:**
- "I'm not a security expert so I would like to know where my blind spots are"

**Raw Transcription:**
> So next section's security. Now I really want to pay a lot of time and attention to security so I think like a security advisor etc. would be a good move. Now some of the thoughts I have here is when we go about our installations for example when we assign you a new skill that really should be going to this security agent and he should advise, he should check online and see if there's any vulnerabilities with the skill, whether it was tested and proven that it was working well and safe. I would also like to have a security debrief every day every morning and I think that takes multiple forms. Well I think the primary form is that we look at our own system and it says, where are the vulnerabilities, how can we improve it and bit by bit we improve it. Now in terms of data, I'm only doing integrations to data sources I don't mind if there's leaks etc. So I know that includes health information and work but it's not financial so I'm okay with that if it does get breached. I mean I don't want it to happen but if it does happen then I can live with it. I would say mostly local, local-based storage etc. And honestly I'm not a security expert so I would like to know where my blind spots are. But yeah, I want to keep prioritizing because if this is not secure or if this fails then I'd be very worried and also I would do more integrations such as my personal email. If this proves to be secure over the course of multiple months.
