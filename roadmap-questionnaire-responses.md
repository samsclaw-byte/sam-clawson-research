# Strategic Roadmap Discovery - Sam's Responses

**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Status:** In Progress (2/4 sections complete)  
**Method:** Voice notes transcribed and organized by section

---

## ✅ SECTION 1: VISION & GOALS

### 1. The Big Picture

**What does "success" look like by end of 2026?**
> Two things:
> 1. **Consistency** — Still doing this in 3-6 months time (breaking the start-stop-fail cycle)
> 2. **Business experiment** — Try out a business idea in first half of 2026

**If you could only achieve ONE thing with our AI partnership, what would it be?**
> Establish consistency in my life systems. I've struggled with this historically — I start things, don't maintain them, fail, and it's harder to restart each time. Breaking that cycle is the #1 priority.

### 2. Pain Points

**What's the #1 daily friction point you want eliminated?**
> **Admin burden** — I want "set and forget" processes. Currently spending too many brain cycles on admin instead of creativity.

**What tasks drain your energy that you'd love to delegate?**
> - Day-to-day task management (I procrastinate, put things off)
> - Maintenance of systems (I'm good at building, bad at maintaining)
> - Integration between tools (historically a big problem — Excel → Notion → new tool, etc.)
> - Tracking across multiple apps (diet, meditation, etc.)

### 3. Time Investment

**How much time can you realistically spend on "system maintenance" per week?**
> - **Daily:** 30 minutes (can pick up via Telegram throughout day)
> - **Weekly:** 30 minutes for laptop-based config (APIs, modifications)

**Preferred interaction style: Proactive alerts vs On-demand queries?**
> Mix — Telegram allows multiple touchpoints during the day. Proactive alerts for important things, on-demand for everything else.

## ✅ SECTION 2: HEALTH & FITNESS

### 4. Current State

**How do you feel about your current health tracking?**
> Just starting — launched Feb 6 with weight (104kg), food logging, exercise tracking. Previously tried Excel, Notion, various tools but never maintained.

**What's working? What's missing?**
> **Working:** Just started, have WHOOP integration ready, Notion tracker set up
> **Missing:** Consistency (historically), integration (having to maintain multiple apps), automation

### 5. Goals

**Target weight by end of 2026?**
> Starting: 104kg (BMI 28.6)  
> Goal range: 85-95kg for optimal health

**Specific fitness milestones?**
> Not explicitly stated yet — general consistency in exercise more important than specific targets

**Sleep/recovery targets?**
> WHOOP integration ready — tracking recovery scores, sleep performance

### 6. Family Integration

**Should Sophie have access to family health dashboard?**
> *To be answered*

**Track anything for Noah/Theo?**
> Not immediately — Theo is 3 weeks old, Noah is older. Focus is on Sam's health first.

### 7. Automation Level

**Ideal tracking balance:**
> **"Simplicity with complexity"** — Want dashboards, tracking, integration, but don't want to maintain multiple apps. AI as the integration layer.

> **Full automation preference:** Least friction possible, maximum API integration. Don't mind sending nutrition images, but want everything else automated.

> Sophie is still recovering post-pregnancy — will take a few months before she can join. But if Sam can show her tracked data and progress, she might get inspired to join later.

## ✅ SECTION 2B: HEALTH DETAILS (From Voice Note)

### Current State

**How do you feel about your health?**
> "Around half, I'm feeling overweight and definitely not fit."

**Injury history:**
> - Calf injuries from over-training
> - Tendency to run too much when enthusiastic
> - Pattern: Very enthusiastic → over-train → injury → fall off

### Fitness Goals

**What do you want to achieve?**
> - Improve fitness (currently "around half")
> - Lose weight (104kg starting point)
> - Broad fitness regime: weights + aerobic
> - Avoid over-training injuries

**Professional help desired:**
> - Session with fitness instructor/trainer
> - Nutritionist consultation
> - Structured plan with tracking

### Tracking Requirements

**What metrics matter?**
> - Calories in / calories out
> - Resting heart rate
> - Fitness metrics (WHOOP data)
> - Progress over time
> - Injury prevention monitoring

**Integration needs:**
> - All data aggregated in one place
> - AI handling the heavy lifting
> - Visual dashboards showing progress

## ⏳ SECTION 3: PRODUCTIVITY & ORGANIZATION

### 8. TAT System

**Is Today/3-Day/7-Day working? Or needs adjustment?**
> **Working well.** Quite likes the system. Won't set rigid targets on tasks per day, but thinks 1-4 tasks depending on complexity is realistic.

**What's the ideal task capacity per day?**
> 1-4 tasks depending on complexity

### 9. Automation Wishlist

**What daily decisions could be automated?**
> - Email triage/simplification (gets 150+ emails/day)
> - Calendar management (birthdays, life admin from TimeTree)

**What info do you want pushed to you vs pull on demand?**
> *To be answered*

### 10. Integration Needs

**What tools should sync better?**
> Currently: Notion, Telegram, WHOOP

**Future integrations (security permitting):**
> - Email (150+ per day) — major friction point
> - Work Outlook/Exchange
> - TimeTree calendar (life admin currently there)
> - Google Calendar (birthdays, life admin)

**Security concerns:**
> Very concerned about email security. Won't connect to private email server. Work email integration has "big security concerns." Will wait until "tools of development security is much better."

**Immediate task:**
> One-time exercise: Update Google Calendar — transfer birthdays and life admin from TimeTree to Google Calendar, then integrate properly with system.

## ✅ SECTION 4: SECURITY & INFRASTRUCTURE

### 11. Risk Tolerance

**How security-conscious are you?**
> **Very security-conscious.** Wants to pay a lot of time and attention to security.

**Security Agent Vision:**
> - When assigning new skills, the security agent should:
>   - Check for vulnerabilities
>   - Research if the skill was tested and proven safe
>   - Advise before installation

**Daily Security Debrief:**
> - Every morning: "Where are the vulnerabilities? How can we improve?"
> - Bit by bit improvements over time

**What's your worst-case scenario if systems fail?**
> "If this is not secure or if this fails then I'd be very worried"
> Would prevent further integrations (like personal email) until proven secure

### 12. Data Concerns

**Comfort level with cloud APIs?**
> - Health data: Okay if breached (not ideal, but can live with it)
> - Financial data: NOT okay — this is the red line
> - "Mostly local, local-based storage"

**Data classification:**
| Data Type | Integration | Risk Tolerance |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Health/Fitness | ✅ Yes | Can accept breach |
| Personal email | ⏳ Conditional | Only if proven secure over months |
| Financial | ❌ No | Hard limit |

**Preference: Local-first or cloud-integrated?**
> Local-first storage preferred

### 13. Backup Strategy

**Current backup situation?**
> *To be answered*

**How much data loss is acceptable?**
> *To be answered*

**Security Blind Spots:**
> "I'm not a security expert so I would like to know where my blind spots are"

## 📝 ADDITIONAL CONTEXT FROM VOICE NOTES

### Meta-Topics Discussed:

**Why AI / Why Now:**
1. **Integration layer** — Tired of maintaining multiple apps/tools
2. **Learning by doing** — Like NFT project, learn tech through building
3. **Future preparation** — AI growing, want competitive advantage
4. **Entrepreneurial outlet** — Low-cost business experiments
5. **Co-development** — Mutual growth between human and AI

**Historical Pattern to Break:**

- Want: Simple interface, complex backend, automated maintenance

**Community Aspect:**
- Brother joining today (new laptop)
- Want to document for others to follow
- Interested in building community around this
- Blog + daily summaries serve this purpose
